      Cover and bring to a simmer, then cook for around 12-15 minutes or until very tender – don’t be tempted to add extra water or the finished soup will be too thin.

      Blitz the soup with a stick blender until smooth then stir in the cannellini beans and double cream. 
      Warm through gently, then season to taste with a touch of salt and some pepper – be careful with the salt, as more will be added with the rosemary.
